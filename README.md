# Storybook with Material UI

This project is a demonstration of using Storybook with Material UI components for React development. It showcases how to:

- Develop and test UI components in isolation.
- Utilize Material UI's design system within Storybook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running Storybook

To start Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook

```

This command will open Storybook in your default browser, where you can view and interact with the components.

### Building the App

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or

```

This will create a `build` folder with all the static assets needed to deploy your app.
